# Training Log Entry 4: June 19-25, 2023

After last week's failed attempt at returning to my regular training schedule, this week's plan to once again aim for 2 workouts on Wednesday and Friday and have the mileage in the low 60s.

## Monday June 19

This run was really all over the place.
In the first half, I my breathing wasn't feeling that great and I had to stop a couple times.
But on the way back, I started to feel better and sped-up quite a bit.
However, when I did pick-up the pace, I did notice my left calf similar to last week.

Ended at 8.5km and was planning to do some strides afterwards but considering how my calf felt I decided to not do them.


## Wednesday June 21

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/4/2.png.webp" /></div>

Extremely nice weather this day.
Started in Mahone Bay and ran my farket workout on the Bay-to-Bay trail.
The workout was 6x(2' on, 2' float).

Overall, it was pretty good.
I felt comfortable on the on's and never struggled to get to the end of a rep.
Paces were all over the place with 4:16/km, 3:58/km, 4:16/km, 4:15/km, 4:11/km, 3:59/km to average 4:09/km.
On the floats, I wasn't recovering as fast as I would've liked which made the floats feel short.
Ended up taking an extra 30s after the 4th rep.
Floats averaged 4:53/km which is slower than I would've liked (goal float pace is <4:40/km).

There's a few parts of the trail that a little sandy, but overall its well maintained and has lots of shade.
One of my goals for this summer is to do the entire 8km trail segment in sub 32 minutes (4:00/km).

## Thursday June 22

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/4/3.png.webp" /></div>

Legs were very tired after the workout, particularly in my hips.
It was also pretty hot so I just slogged my way to get the day's mileage.

My left calf was starting to get concerning in this run even though it was completely fine to the day before.
Could be how the shoes work my calves that is irritating it on the easy days.
I wore my Endorphin Speed 2's for the workout and they also by far my most comfortable shoes in my rotation right now.

While on this run, I came across someone leveling the trail.
The sections that they did made the trail really soft so I hope they either flatten it or that it will firm up on its own quickly.

## Friday June 23

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/4/4.png.webp" /></div>

Did a vertical workout this day which has become my typical Friday workout over the past few months.
The most unique aspect of ultra/mountain races compared to track and road running is how much the elevation gains plays into your approach to a race.
My goal is to limit the amount of time I ever have to power hike during races therefore I have started to make continuous uphill runs a staple in my training.

Around where I currently live, there are zero mountains or very long uphill roads so the best place I have found to do these workouts is a mountain biking trail at the MARC.
This route is about 800m long with a bit over 50m of elevation gain.
The terrain is very technical with lots of roots, large rocks and small drop-offs for the mountain bikers.
The grade also changes frequently but is only flat for some very short segments.
Below is a picture of the trail.

There are no paces in the workout, just a target number of reps and the goal of limiting the number of breaks at the top.
This day I did 4 uphill reps.
Felt decent during the workout.
My breathing wasn't an issue but my legs were definitely not use to the climbing after a few weeks of not doing this workout.
I did the first two reps continuously and then took about a 1 minute break after the 2nd and 3rd reps.

This wasn't the best workout to be doing with how my calf has been feeling lately.
I took the downhills very slow which made them be close to the same pace as my uphills.
However, for me, going that slow makes the recovery not as effective since I am breaking my stride while going down.
This also caused my knees to be a sore which I noticed late in the workout.

Overall with the warm-up and cool-down it came to 11.3km with 250m of climbing for the day.

## Saturday June 24

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/4/5.png.webp" /></div>

My legs were completely fried after the hill workout.
Just did a very short and slow 4km shake-out to get ready for Sunday's long run.
My both my knees didn't feel too good but after the run they feel a bit better.
