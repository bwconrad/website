# Training Log Entry 4: June 19-25, 2023

This will be hopeful be the last week of a short 3 week transition back into my regular training schedule.
After bring back 1 workout last week, the goal for this week is to return my regular schedule of 2 workouts on Wednesday and Friday while keeping the mileage in the low 60s.

This run was really all over the place.
In the first half, I my breathing wasn't feeling that great and I had to stop a couple times.
But on the way back, I started to feel better and sped-up quite a bit.
However, when I did pick-up the pace, I did notice my left calf similar to last week.

Ended at 8.5km and was planning to do some strides afterwards but considering how my calf felt I decided to not do them.

Extremely nice weather this day.
Started in Mahone Bay and ran my farket workout on the Bay-to-Bay trail.
The workout was 6x(2' on, 2' float).

Overall, it was pretty good.
I felt comfortable on the on's and never struggled to get to the end of a rep.
Paces were all over the place with 4:16/km, 3:58/km, 4:16/km, 4:15/km, 4:11/km, 3:59/km to average 4:09/km.
On the floats, I wasn't recovering as fast as I would've liked which made the floats feel short.
Ended up taking an extra 30s after the 4th rep.
Floats averaged 4:53/km which is slower than I would've liked (goal float pace is <4:40/km).

There's a few parts of the trail that a little sandy, but overall its well maintained and has lots of shade.
One of my goals for this summer is to do the entire 8km trail segment in sub 32 minutes (4:00/km).

Legs were very tired after the workout, particularly in my hips.
It was also pretty hot so I just slogged my way to get the day's mileage.

My left calf was starting to get concerning in this run even though it was completely fine to the day before.
Could be how the shoes work my calves that is irritating it on the easy days.
I wore my Endorphin Speed 2's for the workout and they also by far my most comfortable shoes in my rotation right now.

While on this run, I came across someone leveling the trail.
The sections that they did made the trail really soft so I hope they either flatten it or that it will firm up on its own quickly.
