# Training Log Entry 5: June 26 - July 2, 2023

## Monday June 26

Off

## Tuesday June 27

Off. My left calf and my right knee felt really bad so I decided to take an extra day off.

## Wednesday June 28

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/1.png.webp" /></div>

My calf and knee were feeling a little better this morning, so I decided to test them out with a slow run.
I didn't feel very in this run.
The humidity was at 99\% which made breathing pretty difficult and forced me to take a few breaks.
Both my calf and knee didn't feel too good so I didn't go further than 8km.


## Thursday June 29

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/2.png.webp" /></div>

Again, my calf and knee felt a bit better than the day before so the plan was to do 10km easy.
Also again the humidity was at 99\%.

I decided to do the run on the paths near the power lines which I discovered a few weeks back since the rouge terrain will force me to slow down.
The first 1km is all uphill to the trail and right as I got to the top, I had a breathing spasm.
Took a few minutes to get it under control but with the humidity I never that great for the rest of the run.
Once I started back up, I soon found that the trail was completely flooded.
I did try an alternate path which I could get around the flooded areas but it didn't end up leading anywhere so I left the area and got back on the roads.

Since I was already partially up it, I decided to go to the top of lower branch road which if about 100m of elevation gain in a little over 2km.
My legs felt pretty good going up at a reasonable pace but my breathing was struggling and caused me to take a couple breaks going up.
Both my calf and knee were not liking the downhill, so I had to take it fairly slow.
I planned on finishing the 10km on the trail but I started to get really light headed from the heat and had to end it there.

The run ended up being 7km but with 150m of climbing.

## Friday June 30

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/3.png.webp" /></div>

Since I've been struggling to sustain long efforts with the high humidity, I decided to do an interval workout this day.
I've been meaning to do a speed workout anyways since I've been feeling a bit flat these past few weeks.

The workout was 10x400m with 1:30-2' rest and a 5' set break which I ended up doing after the 6th rep since that was the side where my gear was.
I ran this on Mayfair Drive which is a very flat residential road that is a bit over 600m long and has virtually no traffic.
Even though the humidity was still +95\%, it was misty this morning which definitely helped out a lot.

Overall, I am very happy with the workout.
I wore my Prime X's for this and while they never irritated my foot like the last time I used them, they didn't feel extremely comfortable while running at a higher cadence.
Still, I kept the splits even, running between 78-83 seconds and averaging 82 seconds.
I'm most happy with how I kept with the 1:30-2' rest between reps with only the last 2 reps being a few seconds over.
Surprising, I never had any issues with my calf (even after the run), but I could feel my knee in the later reps.

I kinda want to get some of my speed back, so I think I will tag on a few quick reps at the end of my farklet and tempo days.

I had nice long warm-up and cool-downs so the day ended at 13.7km.

## Saturday July 1

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/4.png.webp" /></div>

I felt pretty good this day, the best I've felt after a Friday workout in a while.
Still, because of the humidity it was difficult to keep my breathing relaxed.
Ended up with 5.7km for the day.
My knee is still a bit of an issue but wearing a knee strap removes most of the pain.

## Sunday July 2
