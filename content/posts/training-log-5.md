# Training Log Entry 5: June 26 - July 2, 2023

## Monday June 26

Off

## Tuesday June 27

Off. My left calf and right knee were really sore so I decided to take an extra day off.

## Wednesday June 28

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/1.png.webp" /></div>

My calf and knee felt sightly better this morning, so I decided to test them out with a slow run.
I didn't feel very good during this run.
The humidity was at 99\%, making breathing quite difficult and forced me to take a few breaks.
Both my calf and knee weren't feeling too good, so I didn't go further than 8km.


## Thursday June 29

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/2.png.webp" /></div>

Again, my calf and knee felt slightly better than the previous day, so I planned to do an easy 10km.

I decided to run on the paths near the power lines that I discovered a few weeks ago because the rough terrain would naturally slow me down.
The first 1km was entirely uphill to the trail, and just as I reached the top, I experienced a breathing spasm.
It took a few minutes to get my breathing under control, but due to the humidity, I never felt completely comfortable for the rest of the run.
Once I started back up, I soon discovered that the trail was completely flooded.
I tried an alternate path to get around the flooded areas, but it ended up being a dead end.
Therefore, I decided to leave the area and get back on the roads.

I found myself along Lower Branch Road, and since I had already ascended part of it, I decided to go to top of this hill, which is an elevation gain of ~100m over a little over 2km.
My legs felt quite good as I went up at a reasonable pace, but my breathing was struggling, leading me to take a couple breaks during the climb.
Both my calf and knee didn't respond well to the downhill, so I had to take the descend fairly slow.
My original plan was to tag on a bit on the trail to reach 10km, but I started feeling light-headed due to the heat, forcing me to stop there.

In the end, the run covered 7km with 150m of elevation gain.

## Friday June 30

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/3.png.webp" /></div>

Since I've been struggling to sustain long efforts in the high humidity, I decided to do an interval workout this day.
I've been meaning to do a speed workout anyways, since I've been feeling a bit flat these past few weeks.

The workout consisted of 10x400m with 1:30-2' rest and a 5' set break.
I ended taking the set break after the 6th rep because that ended me on the side where my gear was.
I chose to run this workout on Mayfair Drive, a very flat residential road that is a bit over 600m long and has virtually no traffic.
Despite the humidity being over 95\%, this morning it was misty which definitely helped a lot.

Overall, I am very happy with the workout.
I wore my Prime X's for the workout, and although they never irritated my foot like last time, they didn't feel extremely comfortable while running at a higher cadence.
Nevertheless, I maintained even splits between 78-83 seconds (majority of which were 81-83) and averaged 82 seconds.
What I'm most happy about is how I stuck with the 1:30-2' rest between reps, with only the last 2 reps going a few seconds over.
Surprising, I didn't have any issues with my calf, but I could feel my knee during the later reps.

I really want to get some of my speed back, so I think I will add on a few quick reps at the end of my fartlet and tempo days.

I had a long warm-up and cool-down, so the total volume for the day ended up being 13.7km.

## Saturday July 1

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/4.png.webp" /></div>

I felt pretty good this day, the best I've felt after a Friday workout in a while.
However, because of the humidity, it was difficult to keep by breathing relaxed.
I ended up going 5.7km for the day.
Although my knee is still causing some trouble, wearing a knee strap helps alleviate most of the pain while running.

## Sunday July 2

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/5/5.png.webp" /></div>

I was really unsure about what I wanted to do for this day's long run.
It was still humid, so I didn't want to do a fast long run.
But with how my knee and calf were feeling, I didn't want to risk aggravating them with an excessively long run.
In the end, I decided on doing the loop route starting from Glen Allan and go by feel, running fast if I felt good and taking breaks when needed.

Luckily, it started to rain early on during the run, so the humidity didn't bother me as much.
I took the beginning conservatively, and then walked most of the two steep hills at around the 5km mark.
I also took downhills easy, but since it wasn't bothering my knee significantly I was able to pick up the pace when the grade wasn't too steep.

Because of the shoes I was wearing, I avoided the rocky sections of the trail and took a slight detour on the road.
Along the way, I scoped out alternative routes to access the LaHave trail.
It seems there is a fairly straightforward path through a wooded area that could bridge the two disjointed trails. 
The trail adjacent to the highway is relatively new, so I hope they will eventually create a better connection to avoid having to run alongside the road.

Once I got back into town, I took another break walking up a hill and then pushed the pace for the last relatively flat 3km.
Both my knee and calf started to bother me a bit, but I managed to maintain a decent pace.

Surprising, when I finished the run, I saw that I had only covered 13.8km even though I initially expected the detours to make the route slightly longer.
Regardless, I decided to call it a day at that point.

With this, the 5-day week concluded at 48km.
