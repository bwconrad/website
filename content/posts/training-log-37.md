## Monday February 19

Off

## Tuesday February 20

I was still feeling a bit under the weather, and with the race coming up on Saturday, I decided to take an additional day off.


## Wednesday February 21

{{% card-run "Easy Run" "7.8km" "37:21" "4:48/km" "37m" %}}

After the extra day off, I had a bit more energy, but my legs were still feeling flat during this run.
The entire run felt uncomfortable, with my legs feeling heavy and lacking any pop.
However, I still managed to keep the intensity level low by going at a conservative pace and taking a couple breaks to shake out my legs.

Since I'm tapering this week, the planned distance was shorter, so I ended up running only 7.8km.


## Thursday February 22

{{% card-run "Easy Run" "5.8km" "27:39" "4:46/km" "35m" %}}

Although my legs still weren't perfect, they felt somewhat better on this day's run.
The run was only 5.3km, which felt relaxed but wasn't as effortless as I would've liked.
In the middle of the run, I did 5x100m strides, which all felt decent.

Combining the run and strides brought the total volume for the day to 5.8km.


## Friday February 23

{{% card-run "Easy Run" "3.1km" "14:59" "4:54/km" "17m" %}}

For the day before the race, I opted for a relaxed 3.1km shakeout run. 
My sickness had been improving gradually throughout the week, and though my legs didn't feel entirely fresh, they felt pretty good on this day.


## Saturday February 17

{{% card-workout "Run Ridge Run 25k" "" "25.0km" "3:07:55" "7:30/km" "1157m" %}}

Although it wasn't the outcome I had hoped for, I did successfully complete my first-ever trail race without any major issues.

I will be sharing a detailed recap of the race in a separate post in the coming days.
