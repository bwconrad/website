# Training Log Entry 13:  August 21 - August 27, 2023

I woke up on Monday to find my ankle being incredibly swollen due to the ankle roll on the Sunday's run.
It was the most swollen my ankle had been in a very long time.
However, I could still walk fairly normally after moving around a bit.

Until the swelling went down, I decided to take a few days off from running before making my next decision.
By Thursday, the swelling had mostly gone down, but my ankle was still quite sore when moving laterally.
To let it fully heal, I decided to take the rest of the week off from running.

During the week, I did do a bit of swimming.
On Wednesday and Friday, I swam at a lake to try and maintain some of my aerobic fitness.

Apart from the swimming, I also did some ankle strengthening exercises, and by the end of the week, my ankle felt about 90-95\% healed.
