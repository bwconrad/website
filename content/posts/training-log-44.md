{{% card-run "Easy Run" "10.8km" "51:01" "4:44/km" "57m" %}}

I felt bad throughout this whole run. 
My legs were sore all over, especially my right foot and left calf, making my stride awkward and uncomfortable.
Fortunately, it was only muscle soreness and nothing more serious, so it doesn't seem like I have any significant injuries.

Although it wasn't a relaxing run, I still managed to complete 10.8km.


## Thursday May 2

{{% card-run "Easy Run" "13.0km" "1:01:31" "4:43/km" "66m" %}}

This run was an clear improvement compared to the previous day. 
While I was never got totally relaxed, I was able to find a relatively comfortable rhythm and maintain a steady pace for most of the run.

Although there was still some discomfort in my right foot, the overall leg soreness had improved a little compared to the previous day, and I managed to achieve a solid 13km. 


## Friday May 3

{{% card-workout "Workout:" "7km Ascent/Descent Tempo" "15.5km" "1:19:53" "5:10/km" "383m" %}}

Due to my recent injuries, whether or not I will race next weekend remains uncertain, nonetheless, on this day I did my last scheduled hard session, a 7km ascent/descent tempo run. 

At the start of the climb, I felt surprisingly strong, moving really comfortably through the opening section.
The steeper sections later in the ascent were still challenging, however, I successfully finished the climb feeling stronger than my previous attempts.

Following a two-minute rest, I began the descent, which turned out to be fairly average. 
At times, I felt that I wasn't capitalizing on the downhill very well, while at other other times, I was struggling to get through the punchy uphills.
Moreover, my achilles started bothering me midway through the descent, but fortunately, never began serious.

Overall, the tempo covered 7.7km and about 300m of elevation gain, averaging 5:34/km for the ascent and 4:57/km for the descent.
Including the warm-up and cool-down, the entire session amounted to 15.5km and 383m of elevation gain.


## Saturday May 4

Following the previous day's workout, I started to experience a large amount of swelling and discomfort in my left calf.
Given that my calf has consistently posed problems over the past few months, particularly affecting this current training block, I decided not to participate in the upcoming race and instead concentrate on healing this injury.
