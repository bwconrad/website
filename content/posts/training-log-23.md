# Training Log Entry 23:  November 6 - 12, 2023

## Monday November 6

I went into the first run of the week feeling quite exhausted overall.
Both mentally and physically, I wasn't feeling at my best, which resulted in this run not going very smoothly.
I did start to feel better by the end, but for the majority of the run, I never felt like I could get into a relaxed rhythm.

As for the route, I followed Mines 2 Road, like I did two weeks ago, but took a different path to try to avoid the flooded sections.
Unfortunately, this path also had many flooded sections, so I had to maneuver around the water for a few kilometers.

I forgot to restart my watch after a break, so I'm missing some data, but I estimate the run covered 11.5km all together.

Building on my recent threshold workouts, this day's plan was to do 3x(10 minutes on, 3 minutes float).
When I first planned this workout, I didn't think much of it, however, this was actually a very large increase in volume, with 36 minutes of continuous hard running. 
My main goal was simply to get through the whole workout without any breaks, so I wasn't as concerned with the pace of the floats as I would usually be during fartleks.

I started the workout not feeling particularly strong, but settled into a good rhythm by the end of the first rep.
I felt really comfortable at this pace and managed to maintain it for the remainder of the workout.
The paces for the 10-minute intervals were 4:10/km, 4:04/km and 4:01/km, averaging 4:05/km over 7.3km.
While the floats were a bit slower than usual, as a expected, the average pace was still honest at 4:51/km and I had no issues recovering during the floats.

In total, the fartlek covered 8.6km.
I am extremely satisfied with the results and attribute the success to how I gradually buildup the pace during the fast reps and maintained an honest effort floats.

Including the warm-up and cool-down, the total volume for the session was 15km.

Despite the previous day's hard workout, I felt surprisingly good heading into this run.
My legs were initially a bit sore, but after a few kilometers, they started to move a lot better.
I finished the run feeling good, covering 9.7km on the day.


## Friday November 10

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/23/4.png.webp" /></div>

Given the long Tuesday workout and my plans for a big long run this week, I chose to make this day's workout moderate in both volume and intensity.
What I decided on was a speed workout consisting of 10x300m hills.

I didn't feel especially strong during these hills.
Both my hips and calves were struggling, so I didn't feel like I was driving up the hills that well.
During the final few reps, I focused on shortening my stride, which helped significantly, so I may have been overstriding up to that point.
Despite not feeling strong, my splits were still respectable, averaging 71 seconds per 300m hill.

Including the warm-up and cool-down, the total volume for the day was 13.8km and 200m of elevation gain.

Of note, I've noticed that my cool-downs have become significantly faster recently, likely due to improved aerobic strength.
I don't struggle to complete longer cool-downs anymore and can maintain a more reasonable pace without pushing at all.


## Saturday November 11

This Saturday run was a typical easy recovery session.
I felt pretty good coming off the previous day's workout, but my legs were fairly exhausted from this week's increased volume.
After the run, I finished off with 5x100m strides, bringing the total volume for the day to 5.5km.

## Sunday November 12

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/23/6.png.webp" /></div>

The primary goal for this week's long run was to hit the important milestone of 20km.
I chose a route which I ran about a year ago, so I will be able to compare where my fitness is at.

My body was in good condition going into the run, and stayed that way for most of the time.
Aerobically, I was very strong and my legs were moving well.

Since I felt so good, I found myself settling into a faster than usual pace.
While I managed to maintain this pace for almost the entire run, the final 6-7km was difficult to get through.
This final stretch mentally felt very long, with my legs beginning to fatigue at this point, especially in my right hip.

I ended up taking brief breaks at the 15km and 17km marks.  
Following these breaks, I picked up the pace for the closing kilometers and finished the run at 20km.

Considering the fast average pace I maintained, I'm fairly satisfied with this run.
My aerobic strength was able to handle the volume, so my leg endurance just needs to catch-up, which should come quickly.

This finishes off the week's total mileage at 75.5km with 540m of elevation gain.
