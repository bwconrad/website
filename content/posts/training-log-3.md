# Training Log Entry 3: June 12-18, 2023

This will be hopeful be the last week of a short 3 week transition back into my regular training schedule.
After bring back 1 workout last week, the goal for this week is to return my regular schedule of 2 workouts on Wednesday and Friday while keeping the mileage in the low 60s.

## Monday June 12

Off

## Tuesday June 13

This ended up being a very bad day.
Legs felt heavy from the start but I wasn't too concerned about it, then at only 1k in, I had a really bad breathing spasm.
I walked for about 15-20 minutes before I felt somewhat better but still struggled to get much of anything going.
Decided to stop at a bit over 5k.

After going home, rested for about 15 minutes and went out for another 3k.
This went better but still my breathing felt really bad.
I was also starting to have some inner knee pain which is concerning.

## Wednesday June 14

I had scheduled to do a 5k threshold workout today but since my breathing was feeling really bad, I decided to do my vertical workout instead.
I will go into more the next time I do this workout but for this run I could barely do anything.

My breathing was very contained from the start which made it even difficult to warm up.
After the first rep, could barely move and had to stop the workout there.

I've decided that I'm going to take it easy for the rest of the week and try to do these workouts again next week.

## Thursday June 15

Off.
Tweaked my back so that feels awful again.

## Friday June 16

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/3/2.png.webp" /></div>

Was planning on taking the day off again but in the afternoon I got a really big urge to go for a run and since I was feel pretty good decided to do a short run.

I wanted to pick up the pace, so I did a 10 minute hard effort in the middle of the run.
Wore the Prime X's for this and my right foot was hurting a lot from them for most of this run. 
The shoes were causing my right arch to flare up and could only go about 1k at a time during the hard effort before having to stop.
Ended up averaging 3:53/km for the fast part.

My breathing felt better than earlier in the week but my back and knee were fairly sore afterwards.

## Saturday June 17

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/3/3.png.webp" /></div>

Did 6km at a steady easy pace.
I'm happy with the effort level on this run.
My knee was sore when I woke up but never bothered my while running.
Really trying to work on shortening my stride on easy days to lower the impact on my legs and make slow running feel easier again.

## Sunday June 18

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/posts/training/2023/3/4.png.webp" /></div>

Woke up this morning feeling pretty sore in both hamstrings and my left calf.
For a second, I thought about taking the day off but in the end still decided to do the long run.

The plan was to take it really easy and either turn around early and do 12km or finish a whole loop at close to 15km.
I end
